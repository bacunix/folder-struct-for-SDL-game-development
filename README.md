    Header file (.hpp, .h) directory: include/

    
    .cpp file directory: src/

    
    program directory: bin/release/


    build file directory: build/


    Image directory: assets/images/


    Font directory: assets/fonts/


    Sound directory: assets/sound/



remove all example file in every directory before use.

note:
go to Makefile and edit the path to your SDL2 directory, if you use windows OS, you can clone my SDL2-library repo to C:/User/, so you can use and dont need to edit anything

don't remove .dll files in bin/release/, we need it to compile and run the program


this folder struct made by me and deepseek AI, you can edit the folder struct in Makefile, thanks
